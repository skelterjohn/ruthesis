%% When the \include and \input commands load files, any nested \input or
%% \include (or \includegraphics) commands are treated as though they were
%% issued at the document root level.
%% With the \import command, subsequently included files are loaded relative
%% to the imported directory.

%% The ifpdf package makes available the pdf boolean that (supposedly)
%% indicates whether the document is being compiled by pdfLaTeX (or some

%% more pdfish variants.
