In previous research, LSI has produced a small improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper, we apply LSI to the routing task, which operates under the assumption that a sample of relevant and non-relevant documents is available to use in constructing the query. Once again, LSI slightly improves performance. However, when LSI is used is conduction with statistical classification, there is a dramatic improvement in performance.},
