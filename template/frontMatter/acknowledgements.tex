The journey to a successful Ph.D. is not one that can be made alone. Many people have my special thanks, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
My advisor, Michael Littman, brought me into the world of reinforcement learning when I was still an undergrad. He shepherded me into the Computer Science graduate program at Rutgers, and mentored me throughout my many years as a member of the Rutgers Laboratory for Real Life Reinforcement Learning. His insight and enthusiasm provided the lion's share of my education as a graduate student, and for that he deserves special thanks.

\item
Jason Williams and Suhrid Balakrishnan mentored me during an internship at AT\&T Research, where I was able to solidify much of my current understanding of Bayesian modeling and non-parametrics. Their mentorship was invaluable, and they have my thanks.

\item
All my co-authors that have yet to be mentioned---Lihong Li, Ali Nouri, David Weissman, David Wingate, Haakan Younes, and Robert Zinkov---have helped push my research forward in more ways than one, and they have my thanks.

\item
Over the years, many people have come and gone through the lab, and I consider them all my friends and colleagues. They are
Monica Babes-Vroman,
Erick Chastain
Carlos Diuk,
Sergiu Goschin,
Bethany Leffler,
Lihong Li,
Chris Mansely,
Vukosi Marivate,
Ali Nouri,
Alex Strehl,
Tom Walsh,
Ari Weinstein,
and
Michael Wunder.
I valued our time as colleagues, and thank you all for the priviledge.
