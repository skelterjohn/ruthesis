The Bayesian approach to model-based reinforcement learning provides a principled method for incorporating prior knowledge into the design of an agent, and allows the designer to separate the problems of planning, learning and exploration.  The BOSS and BFS3 algorithms are efficient (polynomial time) mechanisms for decision making within this framework with provable bounds on their accuracy.
